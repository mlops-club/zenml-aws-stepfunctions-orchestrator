# üéº Create a Custom Orchestrator with ZenML

ZenML allows you to [create a custom orchestrator](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/custom), an essential component in any MLOps stack responsible for running your machine learning pipelines. This tutorial guides you through the process of creating an orchestrator that runs each step of a pipeline locally in a docker container.

## ‚ùìWhy would you need a custom orchestrator?

While ZenML comes built with standard integrations for well-known orchestrators like [Airflow](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/airflow), [Kubeflow](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/kubeflow), and even running [locally](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/local), your business might either want to orchestrate your ML workloads differently or slightly tweak the implementations of the standard orchestrators. In this case, this guide is useful, as it implements a relatively simple orchestrator.

The `BaseOrchestrator` abstracts away many of the ZenML-specific details from the actual implementation and exposes a simplified interface. This example is an end-to-end guide on creating a custom orchestrator using ZenML. Click [here](https://docs.zenml.io/stack-components/orchestrators/custom) to learn more about the custom orchestrator interface.

## üíª Tutorial: Creating a custom orchestrator that runs each step in a docker container

### üìë Prerequisites

To run this example, you need to have ZenML locally installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can do so by executing the following commands:

```shell
# clone the repository
git clone ...

# install the necessary dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, you need to have a deployed ZenML server. You can do so by following the instructions [here](https://docs.zenml.io/getting-started/deploying-zenml) or by creating a free account on [ZenML Pro](https://cloud.zenml.io/). Assuming you have a ZenML server, you can run the following command to connect to it:

```shell
# connect to the ZenML server
zenml login <your-zenml-server-url>  # just use `zenml login` if you are using ZenML Pro
```

Please note that you also need to have Docker installed on your machine.

### üöÄ Registering a simple Custom Orchestrator: The `MyDockerOrchestrator`

In order to learn how to create a custom orchestrator, we will start with a simple one. This orchestrator will run each step of the pipeline in a docker container. This orchestrator is a good one to start because it can be coupled with a local artifact store, and
therefore can be run locally.

First, you need to initialize zenml at the root of the repository:

```shell
# initialize zenml at the root of the repository
zenml init
```

Then, you need to register the flavor of the orchestrator:

```shell
# register the flavor of the orchestrator
zenml orchestrator flavor register orchestrator.LocalDockerOrchestratorFlavor 
```

Then, you register your custom orchestrator using your registered flavor:

```shell
# register the custom orchestrator
zenml orchestrator register my_docker_orchestrator -f my_docker  
```

Note in this case, the registration of the orchestrator has no settings, as the orchestrator is not using any
config or settings. Your orchestrator might have more complicated config that you can set here.

### üìù Registering and Setting the Stack

Next, you need to register a stack with your custom orchestrator and the default artifact store attached:

```shell
# register the stack
zenml stack register my_stack -o my_docker_orchestrator -a default
```

Finally, set the stack active. This means every pipeline that runs will use the custom orchestrator:

```shell
# set the stack active
zenml stack set my_stack
```

### üìù Running a Pipeline and Testing the Orchestrator

This example ships with a simple pipeline that runs a `sklearn` pipeline. You can run it by executing the following command:

```shell
# run the pipeline
python run.py
```

By default, the pipeline is configured at runtime with the config file `configs/training_pipeline.yaml`.
When testing the orchestrator, you might want to check certain features like resource and orchestrator settings. You can do so by editing the config file:

```yaml
settings:
  docker:
    required_integrations:
      - sklearn
    requirements:
      - pyarrow
  orchestrator:
    some_setting: "some_value"

resources:
  cpu_count: 4
  memory: "4Gb"
```
